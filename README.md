# Sustainable_menu_DataViz_Tableau
Creation of two dashboards that show the carbon footprint of the food that we eat and propose some changes that would make our diet more sustainable.

[Here](https://ourworldindata.org/food-choice-vs-eating-local) you can find the dataset that I used for this project.

Take a look to the dashboards that I created with Tableau Public [here](https://public.tableau.com/views/ProgettoFoodEmission/Howtocreateamoresustainablemenu?:language=it-IT&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
